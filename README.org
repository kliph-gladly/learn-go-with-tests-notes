* Learn Go With Tests
Following along with https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/

* Hello, World
- Had to turn on yasnippet minor mode to have golang completions work
- I have my editor configured to display tabs as two spaces to make golang more accessible for me
- I have opted to edit files directly rather than tangling so that I can get the benefit of LSP integration in golang
  - [ ] There may be a good way to make it work inside Org-mode but I haven't investigated
  - Pretty cool to be able to test compiler errors in the editor without needing to run the tests :sunglasses:

** Go modules
- [ ] Can I get =go test= to report using dots?

To see a module's godocs:

#+begin_src sh
  godoc -http :8000
#+end_src
